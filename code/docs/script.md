â€Š**Here's what we'll cover in this tutorial:**  

1. First, we'll run **DuckDB UI** locally.  

2. Then, we'll import a **GeoParquet file** into a local table.  

3. Next, we'll log in and **add that table to MotherDuck**.  

4. We'll then **connect GeoBase** to this table.  

5. After that, we'll create a **materialized view** of the table, ensuring it includes a **geospatial column**.  

6. We'll integrate this table into the **UI**.  

7. Then, we'll add an **RPC endpoint** to fetch statistical data.  

8. We'll also add another **RPC function** to retrieve stats based on geographic bounds.  

9. Finally, we'll connect these functions to the **frontend** and explore the **visualization code**.  

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully integrated geospatial data pipeline using **DuckDB, MotherDuck, and GeoBase**. Let's get started!
